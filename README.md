# Building a 2D scatterplot for large-scale dataset with Three.js
In this repo, I develop a performant scatterplot for large datasets, using Three.js (a WebGL library) and d3. I closely follow the guidance from [this](https://observablehq.com/@grantcuster/using-three-js-for-2d-data-visualization) awesome tutorial by Grant Custer on Observable, introducing minor tweaks that fit my use case.
