# Building a 2D scatterplot component for large-scale dataset with Three.js
In this branch of my repo, I try to put the code of the `master` branch into a React component that can be used for visualizing any suitable data in a performant scatterplot. I probably won't go as far as publishing this as a library that can be installed from npm, but let's see where this journey goes in the future :)

## Run code
Type
`yarn` followed by `yarn dev` OR `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`
